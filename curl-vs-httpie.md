# [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) vs [HTTPie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie)

## What both commands do

- Performs HTTP(S) operations specified as URLs
- Need an option to follow redirects
- Support `-v` to show sent request headers
- Support HTTP and SOCKS proxies
- Can do HTTP Range requests
- netrc support

## curl

- Written in C and uses libcurl
- supports many other protocols as well apart from HTTP(S)
- supports any amount of URLs on the command line
- can send binary POSTs
- Supports multiple HTTP methods in a single command line for different URLs
- Documented in a [man page](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) for non-web documentation
- supports HTTP/1.0 requests
- features URL "globbing" for ranges and sequences

- Allows more invasive header modifications, like passing in invalid letters
  in custom headers (HÃ¶st:), replacing Content-Length: in a POST and removing
  the Host: header from a request. Or just adding a header *without* a space
  after the colon.

- Does httpie do happy eyeballs?

- Supports custom connection tricks like with [--resolve
  ](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#--resolve) and
  [--connect-to](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#--connect-to)

## HTTPie "cURL-like tool for humans"

- Written in Python and uses Requests
- Only supports a single URL on the command line
- Has JSON support
- Colored output
- Assumes "name=value" for POSTS (name:value or just "data" is hard/impossible
  to send, not to mention POSTing "Connection:" - which instead will be
  intepreted as remove that header please)
- Can you do multipart a POST with two text-only fields?
- Forbids UTF-8 symbols in HTTP request headers
- Doesn't allow a user to change the Content-Length: header
- Has an "Auth plugin" system that supports many more auth types than curl
- Has no official man page
- HTTP/2 ?
