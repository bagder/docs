# libcurl video tutorials

This is a planned series of video tutorials on how to write Internet applications using libcurl.

Each episode has a title and planned goal and purpose. The source code used and discussed in each episode is made available here
as well as extra links and useful materials.

All code will be written using C. A reasonably modern libcurl version is assumed.
